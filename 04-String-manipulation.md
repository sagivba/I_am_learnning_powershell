## I will use these variables for the examples:
$h = "Hello" 
$w = "world"
$sentence1 = "The meaning of life the universe and everything is 42"
$sentence2 = "We are two souls swimming in a fishbowl"





## concate/join/split
### concat
```powershell
$h + " " + $w # -> 'Hello world'
"$h  $w"      # -> 'Hello world'"
'$h  $w'      # -> '$h  $w'        just like in Perl or bash!
```
### split
```powershell
```

## substring
```powershell
```
## cut
```powershell
```
